# EloquentJs + Angular

This is a single page example of how you might use `parsnick/eloquentjs` with Angular (1.x).

Check [resources/views/welcome.php](https://github.com/parsnick/eloquentjs-example-angular/blob/master/resources/views/welcome.php) for the Angular-specific stuff. Just fire up the server (`php artisan serve`) to play with it in the browser.

Look at the commit history to see the process of adding EloquentJs to an existing Laravel application.

See [parsnick.github.io/eloquentjs](http://parsnick.github.io/eloquentjs) for more on the *EloquentJs* project.
